1. **Hydra Node v1.0.0 Goes Live on Mainnet with Impressive Stress Test Results**  
   Cardano's layer-2 scaling solution, Hydra, has officially launched its production-ready version, enabling faster and more efficient transactions for DeFi, gaming, and real-time apps. A community stress test ("Hydra Doom") demonstrated consistent 650,000+ TPS, with peaks over 1,000,000 TPS and 14 billion+ transactions processed. This marks a major step in addressing scalability challenges. Charles Hoskinson confirmed it's now on mainnet, calling it a game-changer for 2026.
